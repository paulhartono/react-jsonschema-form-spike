# react-jsonschema-form-spike

This is a spike project to test the functionality of https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form.

## What is the reason of the spike

This project also uses https://ui.shadcn.com as the UI component library. Therefore, this spike is intended to future proof how flexible the framework is to be integrated with the same styling. Moreover, this spike also intended to see how we can create a custom field as well as to see how the overall workflow looks like (form submission, validation, errors, etc)
